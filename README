Spell Checker

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are three major approaches that the algorithm takes:
1. Handling duplicates:
	a. For all consecutively repeating characters, that repeat more than twice, 
		A list of words consisting of just one and two letters of the entire 
		repeating substring is generated
		eg. sheeepppp --> shep, shepp, sheep, sheepp

	b. For every character in the word, a list of words with every character 
		repeating from once to thrice is generated.
		eg. pit --> pit, ppit, piit, pitt, ppiit, ppitt, ppiitt, piitt ... 
					pppit, pppiit, pppiiit, pppitt, pppittt, pppiittt .... pppiiittt

2. Handling vowels:
	a. For all vowels in the word, a set of words with each vowel replaced is generated:
		eg. foat --> faat, faet, fait, faot, faut, feat, feet, feit, feot, feut ... fuut

	b. For every candidate generated in previous step (2a), another set of candidates with 
		duplicates is generated from step (1b); i.e. every candidate in step (1a) is passed
		to step (1b) and generates a new set of candidate words.

		This can lead to a drastic increase in search space and runtime if the length of 
		word is large and there are a lot of vowels in the word. 
		eg. foat --> generates 5*5 = 25 candidates 
			each of the 25 candidates generate 

3. Capitalizations
	All words are converted to lowercase.

Hence, Step (1b) has been commented. (Lines 45-51)
It will not work for words like "acount" where a non-vowel edit of greater than 1 is required.
However, if it is uncommented, it will; but with extra time and space.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edit distance based approach (Based on Norvig's implementation of spell checker)
	Find words within edit distance of 2
	This is because otherwise, this spell checker focuses solely on vowel changes and duplicates
	In case a NO_SUGGESTION results for vowels and duplicates, as a last resort before returning
	NO_SUGGESTION, an edit distance based approach is taken to find the closest match.
	This will handle a consonant edit (But not duplicates).

This part of the code is commented currently (299-311)

Also, if it is enabled, the Misspell checker will not work correctly - returning NO_SUGGESTIONS
